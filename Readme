This is the source code for Shokem Nimai, an implementation of the ancient Royal Game of Ur for iPad.
I make no claims as to the ability of this code to be run

Back in the day, this was available on the App Store, but there have since been upkeep tasks / fees that I haven't been maintaining, so it is no longer available

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur :
The Royal Game of Ur is a two-player strategy race board game of the tables family that was first played in ancient Mesopotamia during the early third millennium BC.
The game was popular across the Middle East among people of all social strata and boards for playing it have been found at locations as far away from Mesopotamia as Crete and Sri Lanka.

If you're able to make the code run, enjoy!
